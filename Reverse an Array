You are given an array of integers arr[]. Your task is to reverse the given array.

Approach: Take two pointers to point towards start and end of the array and swap them while traversing.
TC=O(N)
SC=O(1)

void reverseArray(vector<int> &arr) {
        int l=0;
        int h=arr.size()-1;
        while(l<=h){
            swap(arr[l++],arr[h--]);
        }
    }
